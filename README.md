### Amazon HealthLake
is a HIPAA-eligible service that healthcare providers, health insurance companies, and pharmaceutical companies can use to store, transform, query, and analyze large-scale health data.

### Amazon Kendra
is an intelligent search service powered by machine learning. Kendra reimagines enterprise search for your websites and applications so your employees and customers can easily find the content they are looking for, even when it’s scattered across multiple locations and content repositories within your organization.

### Amazon Lex
is a service for building conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. Lex provides the advanced deep learning functionalities of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for converting speech to text, and natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of the text, to enable you to build applications with highly engaging user experiences and lifelike conversational interactions.

### Amazon Lookout
for Equipment analyzes the data from the sensors on your equipment (e.g. pressure in a generator, flow rate of a compressor, revolutions per minute of fans), to automatically train a machine learning model based on just your data, for your equipment – with no ML expertise required.

### Amazon Lookout
for Metrics uses machine learning (ML) to automatically detect and diagnose anomalies in business and operational data, such as a sudden dip in sales revenue or customer acquisition rates.

### Amazon Lookout
for Vision is a machine learning (ML) service that spots defects and anomalies in visual representations using computer vision (CV). With Amazon Lookout for Vision, manufacturing companies can increase quality and reduce operational costs by quickly identifying differences in images of objects at scale.

### Amazon Monitron
is an end-to-end system that uses machine learning (ML) to detect abnormal behavior in industrial machinery, enabling you to implement predictive maintenance and reduce unplanned downtime.

### Amazon Personalize
is a machine learning service that makes it easy for developers to create individualized recommendations for customers using their applications.
<br>Amazon Personalize is like having your own Amazon.com machine learning personalization team at your disposal, 24 hours a day.

### Amazon Polly
is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Polly lets you create applications that talk, enabling you to build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Polly is an Amazon artificial intelligence (AI) service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice.

### Amazon Rekognition
makes it easy to add image and video analysis to your applications using proven, highly scalable, deep learning technology that requires no machine learning expertise to use. With Amazon Rekognition, you can identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos, as well as detect any inappropriate content.

### Amazon SageMaker
is a fully-managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. SageMaker removes all the barriers that typically slow down developers who want to use machine learning.
<br>SageMaker removes the complexity that holds back developer success with each of these steps. SageMaker includes modules that can be used together or independently to build, train, and deploy your machine learning models.

### Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth
helps you build highly accurate training datasets for machine learning quickly. SageMaker Ground Truth offers easy access to public and private human labelers and provides them with built-in workflows and interfaces for common labeling tasks.

### Amazon Textract
is a service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. Amazon Textract goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to also identify the contents of fields in forms and information stored in tables.

### Amazon Transcribe
is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service that makes it easy for developers to add speech-to-text capability to their applications. Using the Amazon Transcribe API, you can analyze audio files stored in Amazon S3 and have the service return a text file of the transcribed speech. You can also send a live audio stream to Amazon Transcribe and receive a stream of transcripts in real time.

### Amazon Translate
